1) Forest Poem
---------------
The forest hums with ancient song,  
Where mossy trails wind soft and long.  
Sunlight filters through the leaves,  
Whispers secrets on the breeze.

2) Art Poem
-----------
A splash of paint, a burst of line,  
Shapes and colours intertwine.  
Canvas holds a hidden dream,  
Art is never what it seems.

3) Happy Poem
--------------
Smile wide and laugh out loud,  
Dance beneath a passing cloud.  
Simple moments, bright and true,  
Happiness belongs to you.
