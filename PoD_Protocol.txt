Poem of the Day (PoD) Protocol
------------------------------

This document explains how my Poem of the Day (PoD) server and any client communicate with each other. I describe it as a Finite-State Machine (FSM) so it’s clear what happens step by step.

Purpose:
--------
The PoD server lets a client connect and get one poem from a small list. The client can choose which poem they want by typing a number.

States (FSM):
-------------
S0 - Waiting:
   - The server is waiting for a client to connect.

S1 - Connected:
   - The client connects. The server sends:
     - A welcome message
     - A numbered list of available poems
     - Instructions for how to pick a poem

S2 - Waiting for Choice:
   - The server waits for the client to type a number.

S3 - Responding:
   - If the number is valid:
       - The server sends back the full poem.
   - If the number is wrong:
       - The server sends back an error message.

S4 - Closing:
   - The server closes the connection. Then it goes back to waiting for a new client.

FSM Flow:
---------
1) S0 → S1
   - The server accepts a new connection.

2) S1 → S2
   - The server sends welcome + list + instructions, then waits.

3) S2 → S3
   - The client sends a number.
   - Server checks if it’s valid or not.
   - Sends poem or error.

4) S3 → S4
   - Server closes the connection.

How to Pick a Poem:
-------------------
The client only needs to send one number, like `1` or `2`.

What the Server Replies:
------------------------
- If it’s a good number: sends back the poem text.
- If it’s not a valid number: sends back an error like “Invalid selection”.

How the Session Ends:
---------------------
After sending the poem or the error, the server closes the connection right away. A new client can connect after.

Example:
---------
1) Client connects with telnet.
2) Server sends: Welcome to Poem of the Day! 
		1) Forest Poem 
		2) Art Poem 
		3) Happy Poem 
3) Client types: '2'
4) Server sends: Art Poem
5) Server closes connection.
